# Comparative analysis
- [x] Examine datapoints
- [x] Confusion matrix over performance

Performance seems to never be quite good as dictionary-based sentiment analysis, rarely is. However a better approach might to create a new dataset which more reasonably represent what I want the model to do (not what other want it to do).

What is that:
- 1) Derive positive/negative sentiment about an entity
- 2) Aspect-based sentiment
- 3) Given a positive/negative statement can confidently say what it is about

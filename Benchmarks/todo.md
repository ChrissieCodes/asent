# Small steps
- [ ] convert pipeline to setters to avoid overwriting attributes
  - [ ] really only the buttom part should be replaced the other parts should be dynamic
  - [ ] Make the getter dynamic such that they store the attribute in e.g. ._.valence (i.e. things that should be able to be overwritten)
    - [ ] valence, intensifiers, getter, span
- [ ] redo dict to match patterns
- [ ]

# Ordered list
- [ ] Convert danish dict to Token matches
- [ ] Use matches to set tokens attributes
- [ ] 


# Comparative analysis
- [x] Examine datapoints
- [x] Confusion matrix over performance

Performance seems to never be quite good as dictionary-based sentiment analysis, rarely is. However a better approach might to create a new dataset which more reasonably represent what I want the model to do (not what other want it to do).

What is that:
- 1) Derive positive/negative sentiment about an entity
- 2) Aspect-based sentiment
- 3) Given a positive/negative statement can confidently say what it is about 
 
# redo Asent
- [ ] Use matchers
- [ ] Use setters instead of getters
- [ ] Redo benchmark using spacy examples
- [ ] Redo lexicons according to catalogue suggestions? (such that it has a make instead of just loading in everything)

# improve docs:
- [ ] Add table of set values

Lav streamlit app over eksempler

# Fixing the grid search
- [ ] redo the grid script such that the grid is a list of runs which each contain a triplet of obj, ext, func
- [ ] create a function to set all the getters, with default for the rest to reset them

# Create pattern estimator for dataset


# Notes
What words are relevant? 

- Positive or negative adjectives
